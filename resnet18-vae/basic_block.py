This module defines the BasicBlock class, which is a custom PyTorch module that represents a basic building block for constructing deeper neural networks, particularly in the context of Residual Networks (ResNets).

The BasicBlock consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation function. It also includes a shortcut connection to facilitate gradient flow and learning in deeper models.

Example:
    from torch import nn
    from basic_block import BasicBlock
    
    # Create a BasicBlock instance with specific input and output channels
    block = BasicBlock(in_channels=64, out_channels=128, stride=2)
    
    # Use the BasicBlock instance in a custom neural network
    class CustomResNet(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(CustomResNet, self).__init__()
            self.layer1 = BasicBlock(3, 64)
            self.layer2 = BasicBlock(64, 128, stride=2)
            # ...
    
        def forward(self, x):
            x = self.layer1(x)
            x = self.layer2(x)
            # ...
            return x
